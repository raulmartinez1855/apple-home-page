# Demo App Created for Boalt

This is a demo app with a sign-in, sign-up, and a product page. The application has one protected route which is the product page. To access please use the Sign Up and Sign In form on the live application (if running locally you can move the product page to an unprotected route). The application uses sessionStorage to fake validation with a backend service.

# Running the app locally
